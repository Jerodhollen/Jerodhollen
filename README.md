- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jerodhollen
- 👀 I’m interested in ... landing a job with a tech company whose central focus is somehow related to music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to write music and play new instruments, high(ish)-level math/coding concepts, and, also learning that I have the power either to find, or create, a life in which I wake up everyday, go to work, and encorporate both sides of my brain into the equation, for the betterment of society.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any project that involves audio/recording software, graphic design/web development for local businesses, as well as song writing and performing!
- 📫 How to reach me ... hollenj2@wwu.edu || jerod.a.hollen@gmail.com || (360) 477-1854
